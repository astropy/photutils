    """
    Class to iteratively perform PSF photometry.

    This is a convenience class that iteratively calls the
    `PSFPhotometry` class to perform PSF photometry on an input image.
    It can be useful for crowded fields where faint sources are very
    close to bright sources and are not detected in the first pass of
    PSF photometry. For complex cases, one may need to manually run
    `PSFPhotometry` in an iterative manner and inspect the residual
    image after each iteration.

    Parameters
    ----------
    psf_model : 2D `astropy.modeling.Model`
        The PSF model to fit to the data. The model must have parameters
        named ``x_0``, ``y_0``, and ``flux``, corresponding to the
        center (x, y) position and flux, or it must have 'x_name',
        'y_name', and 'flux_name' attributes that map to the x, y, and
        flux parameters (i.e., a model output from `make_psf_model`).
        The model must be two-dimensional such that it accepts 2 inputs
        (e.g., x and y) and provides 1 output.

    fit_shape : int or length-2 array_like
        The rectangular shape around the initial center of a source that
        will be used to define the PSF-fitting data. If ``fit_shape``
        is a scalar then a square shape of size ``fit_shape`` will
        be used. If ``fit_shape`` has two elements, they must be in
        ``(ny, nx)`` order. Each element of ``fit_shape`` must be an odd
        number. In general, ``fit_shape`` should be set to a small size
        (e.g., ``(5, 5)``) that covers the region with the highest flux
        signal-to-noise.

    finder : callable or `~photutils.detection.StarFinderBase`
        A callable used to identify sources in an image. The
        ``finder`` must accept a 2D image as input and return a
        `~astropy.table.Table` containing the x and y centroid
        positions. These positions are used as the starting points for
        the PSF fitting. The allowed ``x`` column names are (same suffix
        for ``y``): ``'x_init'``, ``'xinit'``, ``'x'``, ``'x_0'``,
        ``'x0'``, ``'xcentroid'``, ``'x_centroid'``, ``'x_peak'``,
        ``'xcen'``, ``'x_cen'``, ``'xpos'``, ``'x_pos'``, ``'x_fit'``,
        and ``'xfit'``. If `None`, then the initial (x, y) model
        positions must be input using the ``init_params`` keyword
        when calling the class. The (x, y) values in ``init_params``
        override this keyword *only for the first iteration*. If
        this class is run on an image that has units (i.e., a
        `~astropy.units.Quantity` array), then certain ``finder``
        keywords (e.g., ``threshold``) must have the same units. Please
        see the documentation for the specific ``finder`` class for more
        information.

    grouper : `~photutils.psf.SourceGrouper` or callable or `None`, optional
        A callable used to group sources. Typically, grouped sources
        are those that overlap with their neighbors. Sources that are
        grouped are fit simultaneously. The ``grouper`` must accept
        the x and y coordinates of the sources and return an integer
        array of the group id numbers (starting from 1) indicating
        the group in which a given source belongs. If `None`, then no
        grouping is performed, i.e. each source is fit independently.
        The ``group_id`` values in ``init_params`` override this keyword
        *only for the first iteration*. A warning is raised if any group
        size is larger than ``group_warning_threshold`` sources.

    fitter : `~astropy.modeling.fitting.Fitter`, optional
        The fitter object used to perform the fit of the
        model to the data. If `None`, then the default
        `astropy.modeling.fitting.TRFLSQFitter` is used.

    fitter_maxiters : int, optional
        The maximum number of iterations in which the ``fitter`` is
        called for each source. The value can be increased if the fit is
        not converging for sources.

    xy_bounds : `None`, float, or 2-tuple of float, optional
        The maximum distance in pixels that a fitted source can be from
        the initial (x, y) position. If a single float, then the same
        maximum distance is used for both x and y. If a 2-tuple of
        floats, then the distances are in ``(x, y)`` order. If `None`,
        then no bounds are applied. Either value can also be `None` to
        indicate no bound along that axis.

    maxiters : int, optional
        The maximum number of PSF-fitting/subtraction iterations to
        perform.

    mode : {'new', 'all'}, optional
        For the 'new' mode, `PSFPhotometry` is run in each iteration
        only on the new sources detected in the residual image. For the
        'all' mode, `PSFPhotometry` is run in each iteration on all the
        detected sources (from all previous iterations) on the original,
        unsubtracted, data. For the 'all' mode, a source ``grouper``
        must be input. See the Notes section for more details.

    aperture_radius : float, optional
        The radius of the circular aperture used to estimate the initial
        flux of each source. If `None`, then the initial flux values
        must be provided in the ``init_params`` table. The aperture
        radius must be a strictly positive scalar. If initial flux
        values are present in the ``init_params`` table, they will
        override this keyword *only for the first iteration*.

    localbkg_estimator : `~photutils.background.LocalBackground` or `None`, \
            optional
        The object used to estimate the local background around each
        source. If `None`, then no local background is subtracted. The
        ``local_bkg`` values in ``init_params`` override this keyword.
        This option should be used with care, especially in crowded
        fields where the ``fit_shape`` of sources overlap (see Notes
        below).

    group_warning_threshold : int, optional
        The maximum number of sources in a group before a warning is
        raised. If the number of sources in a group exceeds this value,
        a warning is raised to inform the user that fitting such large
        groups may take a long time and be error-prone. The default is
        25 sources.

    sub_shape : `None`, int, or length-2 array_like
        The rectangular shape around the fitted center of a source
        that will be used when subtracting the fitted PSF models.
        If ``sub_shape`` is a scalar then a square shape of size
        ``sub_shape`` will be used. If ``sub_shape`` has two
        elements, they must be in ``(ny, nx)`` order. Each element
        of ``sub_shape`` must be an odd number. If `None`, then
        ``sub_shape`` will be defined by the model bounding box.
        This keyword must be specified if the model does not have a
        ``bounding_box`` attribute.

    progress_bar : bool, optional
        Whether to display a progress bar when fitting the sources
        (or groups). The progress bar requires that the `tqdm
        <https://tqdm.github.io/>`_ optional dependency be installed.

    Notes
    -----
    The data that will be fit for each source is defined by the
    ``fit_shape`` parameter. A cutout will be made around the initial
    center of each source with a shape defined by ``fit_shape``. The PSF
    model will be fit to the data in this region. The cutout region that
    is fit does not shift if the source center shifts during the fit
    iterations. Therefore, the initial source positions should be close
    to the true source positions. One way to ensure this is to use a
    ``finder`` to identify sources in the data.

    If the fitted positions are significantly different from the
    initial positions, one can rerun the `IterativePSFPhotometry` class
    using the fit results as the input ``init_params``, which will
    change the fitted cutout region for each source. After running
    `IterativePSFPhotometry`, you can use the `results_to_init_params`
    method to generate a table of initial parameters that can be used
    in a subsequent call to `IterativePSFPhotometry`. This table will
    contain the fitted (x, y) positions, fluxes, and any other model
    parameters that were fit.

    If the fitted model parameters are NaN, then the source was
    not valid, likely due to not enough valid data pixels in the
    ``fit_shape`` region. The ``flags`` column in the output ``results``
    table indicates the reason why a source was not valid.

    If the fitted model parameter errors are NaN, then either the fit
    did not converge, the model parameter was fixed, or the input
    ``fitter`` did not return parameter errors. For the later case, one
    can try a different Astropy fitter that returns parameter errors.

    The local background value around each source is optionally
    estimated using the ``localbkg_estimator`` or obtained from the
    ``local_bkg`` column in the input ``init_params`` table. This local
    background is then subtracted from the data over the ``fit_shape``
    region for each source before fitting the PSF model. For sources
    where their ``fit_shape`` regions overlap, the local background will
    effectively be subtracted twice in the overlapping ``fit_shape``
    regions, even if the source ``grouper`` is input. This is not an
    issue if the sources are well-separated. However, for crowded
    fields, please use the ``localbkg_estimator`` (or ``local_bkg``
    column in ``init_params``) with care.

    This class has two modes of operation: 'new' and 'all'. For both
    modes, `PSFPhotometry` is first run on the data, a residual image
    is created, and the source finder is run on the residual image to
    detect any new sources.

    In the 'new' mode, `PSFPhotometry` is then run on the residual image
    to fit the PSF model to the new sources. The process is repeated
    until no new sources are detected or a maximum number of iterations
    is reached.

    In the 'all' mode, a new source list combining the sources from
    first `PSFPhotometry` run and the new sources detected in the
    residual image is created. `PSFPhotometry` is then run on the
    original, unsubtracted, data with this combined source list. This
    allows the source ``grouper`` (which is required for the 'all'
    mode) to combine close sources to be fit simultaneously, improving
    the fit. Again, the process is repeated until no new sources are
    detected or a maximum number of iterations is reached.

    Care should be taken in defining the source groups. Simultaneously
    fitting very large source groups is computationally expensive and
    error-prone. Internally, source grouping requires the creation of
    a compound Astropy model. Due to the way compound Astropy models
    are currently constructed, large groups also require excessively
    large amounts of memory; this will hopefully be fixed in a future
    Astropy version. A warning will be raised if the number of sources
    in a group exceeds the ``group_warning_threshold`` value.

            A boolean mask with the same shape as ``data``, where a
            `True` value indicates the corresponding element of ``data``
            is masked.

        error : 2D `~numpy.ndarray`, optional
            The pixel-wise 1-sigma errors of the input ``data``.
            ``error`` is assumed to include *all* sources of
            error, including the Poisson error of the sources (see
            `~photutils.utils.calc_total_error`) . ``error`` must have
            the same shape as the input ``data``. If ``data`` is a
            `~astropy.units.Quantity` array, then ``error`` must also be
            a `~astropy.units.Quantity` array with the same units.

        init_params : `~astropy.table.Table` or `None`, optional
            A table containing the initial guesses of the model
            parameters (e.g., x, y, flux) for each source *only for
            the first iteration*. If the x and y values are not input,
            then the ``finder`` will be used for all iterations. If the
            flux values are not input, then the initial fluxes will be
            measured using the ``aperture_radius`` keyword. Note that
            the initial flux values refer to the model flux parameters
            and are not corrected for local background values (computed
            using ``localbkg_estimator`` or input in a ``local_bkg``
            column) The allowed column names are:

            * ``x_init``, ``xinit``, ``x``, ``x_0``, ``x0``,
              ``xcentroid``, ``x_centroid``, ``x_peak``, ``xcen``,
              ``x_cen``, ``xpos``, ``x_pos``, ``x_fit``, and ``xfit``.

            * ``y_init``, ``yinit``, ``y``, ``y_0``, ``y0``,
              ``ycentroid``, ``y_centroid``, ``y_peak``, ``ycen``,
              ``y_cen``, ``ypos``, ``y_pos``, ``y_fit``, and ``yfit``.

            * ``flux_init``, ``fluxinit``, ``flux``, ``flux_0``,
              ``flux0``, ``flux_fit``, ``fluxfit``, ``source_sum``,
              ``segment_flux``, and ``kron_flux``.

            * If the PSF model has additional free parameters that are
              fit, they can be included in the table. The column
              names must match the parameter names in the PSF model.
              They can also be suffixed with either the "_init" or
              "_fit" suffix. The suffix search order is "_init", ""
              (no suffix), and "_fit". For example, if the PSF model
              has an additional parameter named "sigma", then the
              allowed column names are: "sigma_init", "sigma", and
              "sigma_fit". If the column name is not found in the
              table, then the default value from the PSF model will be
              used. The default values from the PSF model will also be
              used for all iterations after the first.

            The parameter names are searched in the input table in the
            above order, stopping at the first match.

            If ``data`` is a `~astropy.units.Quantity` array, then the
            initial flux values in this table must also must also have
            compatible units.

        Returns
        -------
        table : `~astropy.table.QTable`
            An astropy table with the PSF-fitting results. The table
            will contain the following columns:

            * ``id`` : unique identification number for the source
            * ``group_id`` : unique identification number for the
              source group
            * ``group_size`` : the total number of sources that were
              simultaneously fit along with the given source
            * ``iter_detected`` : the iteration number in which the
              source was detected
            * ``x_init``, ``x_fit``, ``x_err`` : the initial, fit, and
              error of the source x center
            * ``y_init``, ``y_fit``, ``y_err`` : the initial, fit, and
              error of the source y center
            * ``flux_init``, ``flux_fit``, ``flux_err`` : the initial,
              fit, and error of the source flux
            * ``npixfit`` : the number of unmasked pixels used to fit
              the source
            * ``qfit`` : a quality-of-fit metric defined as the
              absolute value of the sum of the fit residuals divided by
              the fit flux
            * ``cfit`` : a quality-of-fit metric defined as the
              fit residual in the initial central pixel value divided by
              the fit flux. NaN values indicate that the central pixel
              was masked.
            * ``reduced_chi2`` : the reduced chi-squared statistic. If
              no ``error`` array is provided, ``reduced_chi2`` values
              will be NaN.
            * ``flags`` : bitwise flag values
