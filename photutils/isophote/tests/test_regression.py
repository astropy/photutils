Despite being cast as a unit test, this code implements regression
testing of the Ellipse algorithm, against results obtained by the
stsdas$analysis/isophote task 'ellipse'.

The stsdas task was run on test images and results were stored in
tables.  The code here runs the Ellipse algorithm on the same images,
producing a list of Isophote instances. The contents of this list then
get compared with the contents of the corresponding table.

Some quantities are compared in assert statements. These were designed
to be executed only when the synth_highsnr.fits image is used as input.
That way, we are mainly checking numerical differences that originate in
the algorithms themselves, and not caused by noise. The quantities
compared this way are:

  - mean intensity: less than 1% diff. for sma > 3 pixels, 5% otherwise
  - ellipticity: less than 1% diff. for sma > 3 pixels, 20% otherwise
  - position angle: less than 1 deg. diff. for sma > 3 pixels, 20 deg.
    otherwise
  - X and Y position: less than 0.2 pixel diff.

For the M51 image we have mostly good agreement with the SPP code in
most of the parameters (mean isophotal intensity agrees within a
fraction of 1% mostly), but every now and then the ellipticity and
position angle of the semi-major axis may differ by a large amount from
what the SPP code measures.  The code also stops prematurely wrt the
larger sma values measured by the SPP code. This is caused by a
difference in the way the gradient relative error is measured in each
case, and suggests that the SPP code may have a bug.

The not-so-good behavior observed in the case of the M51 image is to be
expected though. This image is exactly the type of galaxy image for
which the algorithm *wasn't* designed for. It has an almost negligible
smooth ellipsoidal component, and a lot of lumpy spiral structure that
causes the radial gradient computation to go berserk. On top of that,
the ellipticity is small (roundish isophotes) throughout the image,
causing large relative errors and instability in the fitting algorithm.

For now, we can only check the bilinear integration mode. The mean and
median modes cannot be checked since the original 'ellipse' task has a
bug that causes the creation of erroneous output tables. A partial
comparison could be made if we write new code that reads the standard
output of 'ellipse' instead, captured from screen, and use it as
reference for the regression.
