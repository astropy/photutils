    rectangular_overlap_grid(xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax, nx, ny, width, height,
                             use_exact, subpixels)

    Area of overlap between a rectangle and a pixel grid. The rectangle is
    centered on the origin.

    Parameters
    ----------
    xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax : float
        Extent of the grid in the x and y direction.
    nx, ny : int
        Grid dimensions.
    width : float
        The width of the rectangle
    height : float
        The height of the rectangle
    theta : float
        The position angle of the rectangle in radians (counterclockwise).
    use_exact : 0 or 1
        If set to 1, calculates the exact overlap, while if set to 0, uses a
        subpixel sampling method with ``subpixel`` subpixels in each direction.
    subpixels : int
        If ``use_exact`` is 0, each pixel is resampled by this factor in each
        dimension. Thus, each pixel is divided into ``subpixels ** 2``
        subpixels.

    Returns
    -------
    frac : `~numpy.ndarray`
        2-d array giving the fraction of the overlap.
