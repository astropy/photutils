        """Deprecate a _renamed_ function argument.

        The decorator assumes that the argument with the ``old_name`` was removed
        from the function signature and the ``new_name`` replaced it at the
        **same position** in the signature.  If the ``old_name`` argument is
        given when calling the decorated function the decorator will catch it and
        issue a deprecation warning and pass it on as ``new_name`` argument.

        Parameters
        ----------
        old_name : str or list/tuple thereof
            The old name of the argument.

        new_name : str or list/tuple thereof
            The new name of the argument.

        since : str or number or list/tuple thereof
            The release at which the old argument became deprecated.

        arg_in_kwargs : bool or list/tuple thereof, optional
            If the argument is not a named argument (for example it
            was meant to be consumed by ``**kwargs``) set this to
            ``True``.  Otherwise the decorator will throw an Exception
            if the ``new_name`` cannot be found in the signature of
            the decorated function.
            Default is ``False``.

        relax : bool or list/tuple thereof, optional
            If ``False`` a ``TypeError`` is raised if both ``new_name`` and
            ``old_name`` are given.  If ``True`` the value for ``new_name`` is used
            and a Warning is issued.
            Default is ``False``.

        Raises
        ------
        TypeError
            If the new argument name cannot be found in the function
            signature and arg_in_kwargs was False or if it is used to
            deprecate the name of the ``*args``-, ``**kwargs``-like arguments.
            At runtime such an Error is raised if both the new_name
            and old_name were specified when calling the function and
            "relax=False".

        Notes
        -----
        The decorator should be applied to a function where the **name**
        of an argument was changed but it applies the same logic.

        .. warning::
            If ``old_name`` is a list or tuple the ``new_name`` and ``since`` must
            also be a list or tuple with the same number of entries. ``relax`` and
            ``arg_in_kwarg`` can be a single bool (applied to all) or also a
            list/tuple with the same number of entries like ``new_name``, etc.

        .. warning::
            This decorator needs to access the original signature of the decorated
            function. Therefore this decorator must be the **first** decorator on
            any function if it needs to work for Python before version 3.4.
