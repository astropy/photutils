Reporting Issues and Contributing
=================================

Reporting Issues
----------------

If you have found a bug, please report it by creating
a new issue on the `Photutils GitHub issue tracker
<https://github.com/astropy/photutils/issues>`_. That requires creating
a `free GitHub account <https://github.com/>`_ if you do not have one.

Please include a minimal example that demonstrates the issue and will
allow the developers to reproduce and fix the problem. You may be also
asked to provide information about your operating system and a full
Python stack trace. The developers will walk you through obtaining a
stack trace if it is necessary.


Contributing
------------

Like the `Astropy`_ project, this package is made both by
and for its users. We accept contributions at all levels,
spanning the gamut from fixing a typo in the documentation to
developing a major new feature. We welcome contributors who
will abide by the `Python Software Foundation Code of Conduct
<https://policies.python.org/python.org/code-of-conduct/>`_.

This package follows the same workflow and coding guidelines as
`Astropy`_. Please read the `Astropy Development documentation
<https://docs.astropy.org/en/latest/index_dev.html>`_ to get started.
