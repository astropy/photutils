In addition to these changes, Photutils 2.1 includes several
smaller improvements and bug fixes, which are described in the full
:ref:`changelog`.

Aperture Photometry Output Table
--------------------------------

The ``aperture_photometry`` output table will now include a
``sky_center`` column if ``wcs`` is input, even if the input aperture is
not a sky aperture.

Also, the ``xcenter`` and ``ycenter`` columns in the table returned by
``aperture_photometry`` no longer have (pixel) units for consistency
with other tools in Photutils.


Deblended Labels Mapping in Segmentation Image
----------------------------------------------

The ``SegmentationImage`` class now includes properties to identify and
map any deblended labels. The ``deblended_labels`` property returns a
list of deblended labels, the ``deblended_labels_map`` property returns
a dictionary mapping the deblended labels to the parent labels, and the
``deblended_labels_inverse_map`` property returns a dictionary mapping
the parent labels to the deblended labels.


Star Finder Limits API Change
-----------------------------

Detected sources that match interval ends for sharpness, roundness, and
maximum peak values (``sharplo``, ``sharphi``, ``roundlo``, ``roundhi``,
and ``peakmax``) are now included in the returned table of detected
sources by ``DAOStarFinder`` and ``IRAFStarFinder``. Similarly, detected
sources that match the maximum peak value (``peakmax``) are now included
in the returned table of detected sources by ``StarFinder``.


Find Peaks Border Width
-----------------------

The ``find_peaks`` ``border_width`` keyword can now accept two values,
indicating the border width along the y and x edges, respectively.


Border Exclusion in DAOStarFinder and StarFinder
------------------------------------------------

When ``exclude_border`` is set to ``True`` in the ``DAOStarFinder`` and
``StarFinder`` classes, the excluded border region can now be different
along the x and y edges if the kernel shape is rectangular.


Gini Coefficient Mask
---------------------

An optional ``mask`` keyword was added to the ``gini`` function to allow
for the exclusion of certain pixels from the calculation of the Gini
coefficient.

Also, the ``gini`` function now returns zero instead of NaN if the
(unmasked) data values sum to zero.


New params_map keyword in make_model_image
------------------------------------------

An optional ``params_map`` keyword was added to ``make_model_image`` to
allow a custom mapping between model parameter names and column names
in the parameter table.


Improved GriddedPSFModel Plots
------------------------------

The ``'viridis'`` color map is now the default in the
``GriddedPSFModel`` ``plot_grid`` method when ``deltas=True``.

Also, the ``GriddedPSFModel`` ``plot_grid`` color bar now matches the
height of the displayed image.
