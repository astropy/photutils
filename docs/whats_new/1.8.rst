What's New in Photutils 1.8?
****************************

Here we highlight some of the new functionality of the 1.8 release. In
addition to these major changes, Photutils 1.8 includes a large number
of smaller improvements and bug fixes, which are described in the full
:ref:`changelog`.


API changes to ``RadialProfile`` and ``CurveOfGrowth``
------------------------------------------------------

The API for defining the radial bins for
the `~photutils.profiles.RadialProfile` and
`~photutils.profiles.CurveOfGrowth` classes was changed. The new API
provides more flexibility by allowing the user full control of the
radial bins, including non-uniform radial spacing. Unfortunately, due
to the nature of this change, it was not possible to have a deprecation
phase for the inputs to these classes. Because the changes are not
backwards-compatible, one will need to update how these classes are
created.
