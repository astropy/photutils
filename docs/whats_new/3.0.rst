New Deprecations
================

The ``interpolator`` keyword argument for ``Background2D`` is
now deprecated. When ``interpolator`` is eventually removed, the
``scipy.ndimage.zoom`` cubic spline interpolator will always be used to
resize the low-resolution arrays. The behavior will be identical to the
current ``BkgZoomInterpolator`` default.

Relatedly, the ``BkgIDWInterpolator`` and ``BkgZoomInterpolator``
classes are now deprecated. The ``BkgIDWInterpolator`` is not
well-suited for resizing images on a regular grid to larger sizes. It
is also significantly slower than the default interpolator based on
``scipy.ndimage.zoom``.

The ``grid_from_epsfs`` helper function is now deprecated. This function
creates a ``GriddedPSFModel`` from a list of ePSFs. Instead, use the
``GriddedPSFModel`` class directly.


Removed Deprecations
====================

The following previously deprecated features have been removed:

* The ``Background2D`` ``edge_method`` keyword argument.
* The ``Background2D`` ``background_mesh_masked``,
  ``background_rms_mesh_masked``, and ``mesh_nmasked`` properties.
* The ``BkgZoomInterpolator`` ``grid_mode`` keyword argument.
