What's New in Photutils 3.0?
****************************

Here we highlight some of the new functionality of the 3.0 release.
In addition to these changes, Photutils 3.0 includes several
smaller improvements and bug fixes, which are described in the full
:ref:`changelog`.

New SourceGroups class
======================

A new :class:`~photutils.psf.SourceGroups` class provides a convenient
and feature-rich interface for working with source grouping results. It
includes:

* Direct access to group IDs via the ``groups`` attribute
* Properties for ``n_sources``, ``n_groups``, ``sizes``, and
  ``group_centers``
* The ``get_group_sources(group_id)`` method to retrieve sources in a
  specific group
* A ``plot()`` method to visualize grouping results with color-coded
  apertures

A :class:`~photutils.psf.SourceGroups` object can be returned by the
:class:`~photutils.psf.SourceGrouper` class when called with the
``return_source_groups=True`` keyword argument::

    >>> from photutils.psf import SourceGrouper
    >>> grouper = SourceGrouper(min_separation=10)
    >>> groups = grouper(x, y, return_source_groups=True)
    >>> print(groups.n_groups)  # number of groups

It can also be instantiated directly from source positions and group
IDs::

    >>> from photutils.psf import SourceGroups
    >>> groups = SourceGroups(x, y, group_ids)


Removed Deprecations
====================

The following previously deprecated features have been removed:

* The ``Background2D`` ``edge_method`` keyword argument.
* The ``Background2D`` ``background_mesh_masked``,
  ``background_rms_mesh_masked``, and ``mesh_nmasked`` properties.
* The ``BkgZoomInterpolator`` ``grid_mode`` keyword argument.


New Deprecations
================

The ``interpolator`` keyword argument for ``Background2D`` is
now deprecated. When ``interpolator`` is eventually removed, the
``scipy.ndimage.zoom`` cubic spline interpolator will always be used to
resize the low-resolution arrays. The behavior will be identical to the
current ``BkgZoomInterpolator`` default.

Relatedly, the ``BkgIDWInterpolator`` and ``BkgZoomInterpolator``
classes are now deprecated. The ``BkgIDWInterpolator`` is not
well-suited for resizing images on a regular grid to larger sizes. It
is also significantly slower than the default interpolator based on
``scipy.ndimage.zoom``.

The ``grid_from_epsfs`` helper function is now deprecated. This function
creates a ``GriddedPSFModel`` from a list of ePSFs. Instead, use the
``GriddedPSFModel`` class directly.
