Dependency Version Updates
==========================

Photutils 3.0 bumps the minimum required versions of several key
dependencies to provide users with access to the latest features and
performance improvements:

- NumPy minimum version is now 2.0
- SciPy minimum version is now 1.13
- Matplotlib minimum version is now 3.9
- scikit-image minimum version is now 0.23


Refactored ePSF Building
=========================

The ePSF building tools have been significantly refactored for improved
robustness, better diagnostics, and a cleaner API.

New EPSFBuildResult class
-------------------------

:class:`~photutils.psf.EPSFBuilder` now returns an
:class:`~photutils.psf.EPSFBuildResult` dataclass instead of a plain
tuple. The result object provides structured access to detailed build
diagnostics::

    >>> from photutils.psf import EPSFBuilder
    >>> builder = EPSFBuilder(oversampling=4)
    >>> result = builder(stars)
    >>> result.epsf  # the constructed ePSF (ImagePSF)
    >>> result.fitted_stars  # stars with updated centers/fluxes
    >>> result.iterations  # number of iterations performed
    >>> result.converged  # whether the build converged
    >>> result.final_center_accuracy  # max center shift in last iteration

Backward compatibility is maintained. Existing code using tuple
unpacking will continue to work::

    >>> epsf, stars = builder(stars)

Improved star exclusion handling
--------------------------------

Stars that repeatedly fail fitting are now automatically excluded from
subsequent iterations, with informative warnings indicating the reason
for exclusion (e.g., fit region extends beyond the cutout, or the fit
did not converge). The number of excluded stars and their indices are
reported in the :class:`~photutils.psf.EPSFBuildResult`.


New SourceGroups class
======================

A new :class:`~photutils.psf.SourceGroups` class provides a convenient
and feature-rich interface for working with source grouping results. It
includes:

* Direct access to group IDs via the ``groups`` attribute
* Properties for ``n_sources``, ``n_groups``, ``sizes``, and
  ``group_centers``
* The ``get_group_sources(group_id)`` method to retrieve sources in a
  specific group
* A ``plot()`` method to visualize grouping results with color-coded
  apertures

A :class:`~photutils.psf.SourceGroups` object can be returned by the
:class:`~photutils.psf.SourceGrouper` class when called with the
``return_source_groups=True`` keyword argument::

    >>> from photutils.psf import SourceGrouper
    >>> grouper = SourceGrouper(min_separation=10)
    >>> groups = grouper(x, y, return_source_groups=True)
    >>> print(groups.n_groups)  # number of groups

It can also be instantiated directly from source positions and group
IDs::

    >>> from photutils.psf import SourceGroups
    >>> groups = SourceGroups(x, y, group_ids)


New CentroidQuadratic class
============================

A new :class:`~photutils.centroids.CentroidQuadratic`
class provides a callable object interface to the
:func:`~photutils.centroids.centroid_quadratic` function. This
class allows users to create a centroid function with specific
fit parameters that can be reused multiple times. This is
particularly useful when passing customized centroid functions to
:func:`~photutils.centroids.centroid_sources` or other functions that
accept a centroid function as an argument.

The class is initialized with the desired ``fit_boxsize`` parameter,
and then can be called with ``data`` and optional ``mask`` parameter::

    >>> from photutils.centroids import CentroidQuadratic
    >>> centroid_func = CentroidQuadratic(fit_boxsize=7)
    >>> x, y = centroid_func(data, mask=mask)

This is especially beneficial when using
:func:`~photutils.centroids.centroid_sources` with fine-tuned centroid
parameters::

    >>> from photutils.centroids import centroid_sources
    >>> centroid_func = CentroidQuadratic(fit_boxsize=11)
    >>> x, y = centroid_sources(data, x_init, y_init, box_size=25,
    ...                         centroid_func=centroid_func)


Improved Handling of Non-Finite Local Background Values in PSF Photometry
=========================================================================

:class:`~photutils.psf.PSFPhotometry` and
:class:`~photutils.psf.IterativePSFPhotometry` now gracefully handle
non-finite (NaN or inf) local background values instead of raising an
error. This situation can occur when the local background estimator
encounters fully masked regions within the background annulus.

When a non-finite local background value is encountered:

1. The actual non-finite value is preserved and reported in the output
   table's ``local_bkg`` column
2. The value is not subtracted from the data before PSF fitting
3. A new flag (bit 2048, ``NON_FINITE_LOCALBKG``) is set in the
   ``flags`` column to indicate the issue

This allows users to identify and handle problematic sources
appropriately while still obtaining PSF fitting results where possible.


Enhanced PSF Photometry Result Conversion Methods
==================================================

The :meth:`~photutils.psf.PSFPhotometry.results_to_init_params` and
:meth:`~photutils.psf.PSFPhotometry.results_to_model_params` methods
(and their :class:`~photutils.psf.IterativePSFPhotometry` equivalents)
now support two new optional keyword arguments:

* ``remove_invalid``: When ``True``, removes sources with non-finite
  fitted parameters (positions or flux) or invalid flags from the
  output table. This is useful for iterative PSF photometry workflows
  where you want to exclude failed fits from subsequent iterations.

* ``reset_ids``: When ``True``, renumbers the source IDs sequentially
  starting from 1. This is particularly useful in combination with
  ``remove_invalid=True`` to maintain consecutive IDs after removing
  sources.

These options provide more flexibility when converting PSF photometry
results for use in subsequent fitting iterations or other analyses.


New PSF decode_flags convenience method
=======================================

The :class:`~photutils.psf.PSFPhotometry` and
:class:`~photutils.psf.IterativePSFPhotometry` classes now have a
convenient ``decode_flags()`` method that decodes the bitwise flags from
the ``'flags'`` column in the results table. The method returns a list
of lists, where each inner list contains the active flag names for the
corresponding source. This makes it easy to interpret which conditions
were encountered during PSF fitting for each source.


New ImagePSF shape property
===========================

:class:`~photutils.psf.ImagePSF` now has a ``shape`` property that
returns the shape of the (oversampled) PSF data array.


New Curve of Growth Classes
===========================

Two new curve-of-growth classes have been added to the
`~photutils.profiles` subpackage:

* :class:`~photutils.profiles.EnsquaredCurveOfGrowth`: Computes a curve
  of growth using concentric square apertures. The profile is measured
  as a function of half the square's side length.

* :class:`~photutils.profiles.EllipticalCurveOfGrowth`: Computes a
  curve of growth using concentric elliptical apertures with a
  user-defined fixed axis ratio and orientation. The profile is measured
  as a function of the semimajor-axis length.

These complement the existing :class:`~photutils.profiles.CurveOfGrowth`
class, which uses concentric circular apertures.

:class:`~photutils.profiles.EnsquaredCurveOfGrowth` example::

    >>> from photutils.profiles import EnsquaredCurveOfGrowth
    >>> half_sizes = np.arange(1, 26)  # half-sizes of the square apertures
    >>> ecog = EnsquaredCurveOfGrowth(data, xycen, half_sizes, error=error,
    ...                               mask=None)
    >>> ecog.normalize()
    >>> ee_vals = ecog.calc_ee_at_half_size(np.array([3, 6, 9]))

:class:`~photutils.profiles.EllipticalCurveOfGrowth` example::

    >>> from photutils.profiles import EllipticalCurveOfGrowth
    >>> radii = np.arange(1, 26)  # semimajor-axis lengths
    >>> ecog = EllipticalCurveOfGrowth(data, xycen, radii, axis_ratio=0.5,
    ...                               theta=0.0, error=error, mask=None)
    >>> ecog.normalize()
    >>> ee_vals = ecog.calc_ee_at_radius(np.array([5, 10, 15]))


Moffat Fitting for Radial Profiles
==================================

:class:`~photutils.profiles.RadialProfile` now supports fitting a 1D
Moffat model (using `~astropy.modeling.functional_models.Moffat1D`) to
the radial profile, complementing the existing Gaussian fitting
capability. Three new properties are available:

* ``moffat_fit``: The fitted
  `~astropy.modeling.functional_models.Moffat1D` model.
* ``moffat_profile``: The fitted 1D Moffat evaluated at the profile
  radii.
* ``moffat_fwhm``: The FWHM from the fitted Moffat model.

Moffat profiles have broader wings than Gaussians and are often a
better representation of astronomical point-spread functions::

    >>> rp = RadialProfile(data, xycen, edge_radii, error=error)
    >>> rp.moffat_fit
    <Moffat1D(...)>
    >>> print(rp.moffat_fwhm)  # doctest: +SKIP
    11.2

Plot the fitted Moffat on the radial profile::

    >>> fig, ax = plt.subplots()
    >>> rp.plot(ax=ax, label='Radial Profile')
    >>> ax.plot(rp.radius, rp.moffat_profile, label='Moffat Fit')
    >>> ax.legend()


Improved PSF Matching Tools
===========================

The PSF matching module has been significantly improved with better
validation, regularization, and documentation.

New regularization parameter
-----------------------------

The :func:`~photutils.psf_matching.make_kernel` function now includes a
``regularization`` parameter to regularize division by near-zero values
in the Fourier domain. This prevents numerical instabilities when the
source PSF has very small Fourier coefficients::

    >>> from photutils.psf_matching import make_kernel
    >>> kernel = make_kernel(source_psf, target_psf, regularization=1e-4)

The default value of ``1e-4`` provides good regularization for most
cases, but can be adjusted based on the noise characteristics of your
PSFs.

Improved validation
-------------------

Both :func:`~photutils.psf_matching.make_kernel` and
:func:`~photutils.psf_matching.resize_psf` now validate their inputs:

* PSFs must be 2D arrays with odd dimensions
* Window functions must return valid 2D arrays with values between [0, 1]
* Pixel scales must be positive
* PSFs should be centered (a warning is issued if not)

New PSF Matching Function with Wiener Regularization
----------------------------------------------------

A new :func:`~photutils.psf_matching.make_wiener_kernel`
function has been added to the ``psf_matching`` subpackage.

This function computes a Wiener-regularized PSF-matching kernel in the
Fourier domain. The denominator includes a regularization term that
stabilizes inversion of the source OTF (Optical Transfer Function, the
Fourier transform of the PSF) by preventing division by small values,
thereby suppressing noise amplification at spatial frequencies where the
source response is weak.

This method is particularly useful when working with PSFs
that have near-zero power at high spatial frequencies (e.g.,
diffraction-limited PSFs), where the hard amplitude thresholding
used by :func:`~photutils.psf_matching.make_kernel` can introduce
discontinuities in Fourier space. Wiener regularization instead smoothly
down-weights those frequencies, producing matching kernels with less
ringing and often eliminating the need to carefully tune a window
function.

When no ``penalty`` is provided (default), the regularization is a
frequency-independent (zero-order scalar) Tikhonov term expressed as a
fraction of the peak power in the source OTF::

    >>> from photutils.psf_matching import make_wiener_kernel
    >>> kernel = make_wiener_kernel(source_psf, target_psf)

The function also supports a ``penalty`` parameter for
frequency-dependent regularization. Setting ``penalty='laplacian'`` uses
a discrete Laplacian operator that penalizes high spatial frequencies
more heavily, reproducing the regularization approach used by the
``pypher`` package (`Boucaud et al. 2016`_)::

    >>> kernel = make_wiener_kernel(source_psf, target_psf,
    ...                             penalty='laplacian')

Removed Deprecations
====================

The following previously deprecated features from the
``background`` package have been removed:

* The ``Background2D`` ``edge_method`` keyword argument.
* The ``Background2D`` ``background_mesh_masked``,
  ``background_rms_mesh_masked``, and ``mesh_nmasked`` properties.
* The ``BkgZoomInterpolator`` ``grid_mode`` keyword argument.

For the ``psf`` package, the previously deprecated
``FittableImageModel`` and ``EPSFModel`` classes have been removed. Use
:class:`~photutils.psf.ImagePSF` instead.


New Deprecations
================

Background Package
------------------

The ``interpolator`` keyword argument for ``Background2D`` is
now deprecated. When ``interpolator`` is eventually removed, the
``scipy.ndimage.zoom`` cubic spline interpolator will always be used to
resize the low-resolution arrays. The behavior will be identical to the
current ``BkgZoomInterpolator`` default.

Relatedly, the ``BkgIDWInterpolator`` and ``BkgZoomInterpolator``
classes are now deprecated. The ``BkgIDWInterpolator`` is not
well-suited for resizing images on a regular grid to larger sizes. It
is also significantly slower than the default interpolator based on
``scipy.ndimage.zoom``. The ``BkgZoomInterpolator`` functionality will
be preserved in the default resizing behavior of ``Background2D``.

Centroids Package
-----------------

The ``xpeak``, ``ypeak``, and ``search_boxsize`` keyword arguments
for :func:`~photutils.centroids.centroid_quadratic` function are now
deprecated. Use the :func:`~photutils.centroids.centroid_sources`
function to centroid sources at specific positions.

PSF Matching Package
--------------------

The ``photutils.psf.matching`` subpackage has been moved to be a
top-level package at ``photutils.psf_matching``. This change improves
consistency with photutils' other top-level subpackages (``aperture``,
``background``, ``centroids``, ``detection``, etc.), as PSF matching
is a functionally independent tool for generating convolution kernels
rather than part of the core PSF photometry workflow.

Importing from the old location (``photutils.psf.matching``) is
deprecated and will be removed in a future version. Update your
imports::

    # Old (deprecated)
    from photutils.psf.matching import make_kernel

    # New
    from photutils.psf_matching import make_kernel

The PSF matching function ``create_matching_kernel`` has been renamed
to ``make_kernel`` for brevity and consistency with Python naming
conventions. The old function name is deprecated and will be removed in
a future version. Update your code to use the new name::

    # Old (deprecated)
    from photutils.psf.matching import create_matching_kernel
    from photutils.psf_matching import create_matching_kernel

    # New
    from photutils.psf_matching import make_kernel

PSF Package
-----------

The ``grid_from_epsfs`` helper function is now deprecated. This function
creates a ``GriddedPSFModel`` from a list of ePSFs. Instead, use the
``GriddedPSFModel`` class directly.

The :class:`~photutils.psf.EPSFFitter` class is now deprecated.
To customize the ePSF fitting process, use the ``fitter``,
``fit_shape``, and ``fitter_maxiters`` parameters of
:class:`~photutils.psf.EPSFBuilder` directly instead of creating an
``EPSFFitter`` instance.


Breaking Changes
================

The ``EPSFBuilder.build_epsf()`` method has been removed. Use the
``EPSFBuilder`` callable interface instead (i.e., ``builder(stars)``).

The ``norm_radius`` keyword has been removed from
:class:`~photutils.psf.EPSFBuilder`. This keyword is no
longer relevant because the ePSF is now built directly as an
:class:`~photutils.psf.ImagePSF`, which does not use a normalization
radius.

All functions in the `~photutils.centroids` package now require
keyword-only arguments.
