What's New in Photutils 1.10?
*****************************

Here we highlight some of the new functionality of the 1.10 release.
In addition to these changes, Photutils 1.10 includes a large number
of smaller improvements and bug fixes, which are described in the full
:ref:`changelog`.


Reading WebbPSF Gridded PSF Models
----------------------------------

The `~photutils.psf.GriddedPSFModel` ``read`` method can now
read FITS files containing ePSF grids that were generated by `WebbPSF
<https://webbpsf.readthedocs.io/>`_.


Minimum separation parameter for ``DAOStarFinder`` and ``IRAFStarFinder``
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

An optional ``min_separation`` keyword is now available
in the `~photutils.detection.DAOStarFinder` and
`~photutils.detection.IRAFStarFinder` classes. This parameter defines a
minimum separation (in pixels) for detected objects.


PSF photometry models
---------------------

A `~photutils.psf.make_psf_model` function was added for making a PSF
model from a 2D Astropy model. Compound models are also supported.
The output PSF model can be used in the PSF photometry classes. This
function replaces the deprecated `~photutils.psf.prepare_psf_model`
function.


``GriddedPSFModel`` oversampling
--------------------------------

The `~photutils.psf.GriddedPSFModel` oversampling can now be different
in the x and y directions. The ``oversampling`` attribute is now stored
as a 1D `numpy.ndarray` with two elements.
