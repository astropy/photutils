PSF Photometry (`photutils.psf`)
================================

The `photutils.psf` subpackage contains tools for model-fitting
photometry, often called "PSF photometry".


.. _psf-terminology:

Terminology
-----------

Different astronomy subfields use the terms "PSF", "PRF", or related
terms somewhat differently, especially when colloquial usage is taken
into account. The `photutils.psf` package aims to be internally
consistent, following the definitions described here.

We take the Point Spread Function (PSF), or instrumental Point
Spread Function (iPSF) to be the infinite-resolution and
infinite-signal-to-noise flux distribution from a point source on
the detector, after passing through optics, dust, atmosphere, etc.
By contrast, the function describing the responsivity variations
across individual *pixels* is the pixel response function. The
pixel response function is sometimes called the "PRF", but we
do not use that acronym here to avoid confusion with the "Point
Response Function" (see below). The convolution of the PSF and
pixel response function, when discretized onto the detector
(i.e., a rectilinear grid), is the effective PSF (ePSF) or Point
Response Function (PRF). The PRF terminology is sometimes used to
emphasize that the model function describes the response of the
detector to a point source, rather than the intrinsic instrumental
PSF (e.g., see the `Spitzer Space Telescope MOPEX documentation
<https://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/data/SPITZER/docs/dataanalysistools/tools
/mopex/mopexusersguide/89/>`_).

In many cases the PSF/PRF/ePSF distinction is unimportant, and the
PSF/PRF/ePSF are simply called the "PSF" model, but the distinction
can be critical when dealing carefully with undersampled data or
detectors with significant intra-pixel sensitivity variations. For a
more detailed description of this formalism, see `Anderson & King 2000
<https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2000PASP..112.1360A/abstract>`_.

In colloquial usage, "PSF photometry" sometimes refers to the
more general task of model-fitting photometry with the effects of
the PSF either implicitly or explicitly included in the models,
regardless of exactly what kind of model is actually being fit. In the
``photutils.psf`` package, we use "PSF photometry" in this way, as a
shorthand for the general approach.


PSF Photometry Overview
-----------------------

Photutils provides a modular set of tools to perform PSF photometry
for different science cases. The tools are implemented as classes that
perform various subtasks of PSF photometry. High-level classes are also
provided to connect these pieces together.

The two main PSF-photometry classes are `~photutils.psf.PSFPhotometry`
and `~photutils.psf.IterativePSFPhotometry`.
`~photutils.psf.PSFPhotometry` provides the framework for a flexible PSF
photometry workflow that can find sources in an image, optionally group
overlapping sources, fit the PSF model to the sources, and subtract the
fit PSF models from the image.

`~photutils.psf.IterativePSFPhotometry` is an iterative version of
`~photutils.psf.PSFPhotometry` where new sources are detected in the
residual image after the fit sources are subtracted. The iterative
process can be useful for crowded fields where sources are blended. A
``mode`` keyword is provided to control the behavior of the iterative
process, where either all sources or only the newly-detected sources are
fit in subsequent iterations. The process repeats until no additional
sources are detected or a maximum number of iterations has been
reached. When used with the `~photutils.detection.DAOStarFinder`,
`~photutils.psf.IterativePSFPhotometry` is essentially an implementation
of the DAOPHOT algorithm described by Stetson in his `seminal paper
<https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1987PASP...99..191S/abstract>`_ for
crowded-field stellar photometry.

The star-finding step is controlled by the ``finder``
keyword, where one inputs a callable function or class
instance. Typically, this would be one of the star-detection
classes implemented in the `photutils.detection`
subpackage, e.g., `~photutils.detection.DAOStarFinder`,
`~photutils.detection.IRAFStarFinder`, or
`~photutils.detection.StarFinder`.

After finding sources, one can optionally apply a clustering algorithm
to group overlapping sources using the ``grouper`` keyword. Usually,
groups are formed by a distance criterion, which is the case of the
grouping algorithm proposed by Stetson. Stars that grouped are fit
simultaneously. The reason behind the construction of groups and not
fitting all stars simultaneously is illustrated as follows: imagine
that one would like to fit 300 stars and the model for each star has
three parameters to be fitted. If one constructs a single model to fit
the 300 stars simultaneously, then the optimization algorithm will
have to search for the solution in a 900-dimensional space, which
is computationally expensive and error-prone. Having smaller groups
of stars effectively reduces the dimension of the parameter space,
which facilitates the optimization process. For more details see
:ref:`psf-grouping`.

The local background around each source can optionally be subtracted
using the ``localbkg_estimator`` keyword. This keyword accepts a
`~photutils.background.LocalBackground` instance that estimates the
local statistics in a circular annulus aperture centered on each source.
The size of the annulus and the statistic function can be configured in
`~photutils.background.LocalBackground`.

The next step is to fit the sources and/or groups. This
task is performed using an astropy fitter, for example
`~astropy.modeling.fitting.TRFLSQFitter`, input via the ``fitter``
keyword. The shape of the region to be fitted can be configured using
the ``fit_shape`` parameter. In general, ``fit_shape`` should be set
to a small size (e.g., (5, 5)) that covers the central star region
with the highest flux signal-to-noise. The initial positions are
derived from the ``finder`` algorithm. The initial flux values for the
fit are derived from measuring the flux in a circular aperture with
radius ``aperture_radius``. The initial positions and fluxes can be
alternatively input in a table via the ``init_params`` keyword when
calling the class.

After sources are fitted, a model image of the fit
sources or a residual image can be generated using the
:meth:`~photutils.psf.PSFPhotometry.make_model_image` and
:meth:`~photutils.psf.PSFPhotometry.make_residual_image` methods,
respectively.

For `~photutils.psf.IterativePSFPhotometry`, the above steps can be
repeated until no additional sources are detected (or until a maximum
number of iterations is reached).

The `~photutils.psf.PSFPhotometry` and
`~photutils.psf.IterativePSFPhotometry` classes provide the structure
in which the PSF-fitting steps described above are performed, but
all the stages can be turned on or off or replaced with different
implementations as the user desires. This makes the tools very flexible.
One can also bypass several of the steps by directly inputting to
``init_params`` an astropy table containing the initial parameters for
the source centers, fluxes, group identifiers, and local backgrounds.
This is also useful if one is interested in fitting only one or a few
sources in an image.


.. _psf-models:

PSF Models
----------

As mentioned above, PSF photometry fundamentally involves fitting
models to data. As such, the PSF model is a critical component of PSF
photometry. For accurate results, both for photometry and astrometry,
the PSF model should be a good representation of the actual data. The
PSF model can be a simple analytic function, such as a 2D Gaussian
or Moffat profile, or it can be a more complex model derived from a
2D PSF image, e.g., an effective PSF (ePSF). The PSF model can also
encapsulate changes in the PSF across the detector, e.g., due to optical
aberrations.

For image-based PSF models, the PSF model is typically derived from
observed data or from detailed optical modeling. The PSF model can
be a single PSF model for the entire image or a grid of PSF models
at fiducial detector positions. The PSF model image is also often
oversampled to increase the accuracy of the PSF model.

The observatory that obtained the data may provide tools for
creating PSF models for their data or an empirical library of
PSF models based on previous observations. For example, the
`Hubble Space Telescope <https://www.stsci.edu/hst>`_ provides
both libraries of empirical PSF models (e.g., `WFC3 PSF Search
<https://www.stsci.edu/hst/instrumentation/wfc3/data-analysis/psf/psf-se
arch>`_) and the `TinyTim
<https://www.stsci.edu/hst/instrumentation/focus-and-pointing/focus/tiny
-tim-hst-psf-modeling>`_ software for creating PSF models. Similarly,
the `James Webb Space Telescope <https://www.stsci.edu/jwst>`_ provides
the `WebbPSF <https://webbpsf.readthedocs.io/>`_ Python software for
creating PSF models. In particular, WebbPSF outputs gridded PSF models
directly as Photutils `~photutils.psf.GriddedPSFModel` instances.

If you cannot obtain a PSF model from an empirical library or
observatory-provided tool, Photutils provides tools for creating an
empirical PSF model from the data itself, provided you have a large
number of isolated stars. Please see :ref:`build-epsf` for more
information and an example.

The `photutils.psf` subpackage provides several PSF models that
can be used for PSF photometry. The PSF models are based on the
:ref:`Astropy models and fitting <astropy:astropy-modeling>` framework.
The PSF models are used as input (via the ``psf_model`` parameter)
to the PSF photometry classes `~photutils.psf.PSFPhotometry` and
`~photutils.psf.IterativePSFPhotometry`. The PSF models are fitted to
the data using an Astropy fitter class. Typically, the model position
(``x_0`` and ``y_0``) and flux (``flux``) parameters are varied
during the fitting process. The PSF model can also include additional
parameters, such as the full width at half maximum (FWHM) or sigma of
a Gaussian PSF or the alpha and beta parameters of a Moffat PSF. By
default, these additional parameters are "fixed" (i.e., not varied
during the fitting process). The user can choose to also vary these
parameters by setting the ``fixed`` attribute on the model parameter
to `False`. The position and/or flux parameters can also be fixed
during the fitting process if needed, e.g., for forced photometry (see
:ref:`psf-forced-photometry`). Any of the model parameters can also be
bounded during the fitting process (see :ref:`psf-bounded-parameters`).

You can also create your own custom PSF model using the Astropy modeling
framework. The PSF model must be a 2D model that is a subclass of
`~astropy.modeling.Fittable2DModel`. It must have parameters called
``x_0``, ``y_0``, and ``flux``, specifying the central position and
total integrated flux, and it should be normalized to unit flux.


Analytic PSF Models
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- `~photutils.psf.GaussianPSF`: a general 2D Gaussian PSF model
  parameterized in terms of the position, total flux, and full width
  at half maximum (FWHM) along the x and y axes. Rotation can also be
  included.

- `~photutils.psf.CircularGaussianPSF`: a circular 2D Gaussian PSF model
  parameterized in terms of the position, total flux, and FWHM.

- `~photutils.psf.GaussianPRF`: a general 2D Gaussian PSF model
  parameterized in terms of the position, total flux, and FWHM
  along the x and y axes. Rotation can also be included.

- `~photutils.psf.CircularGaussianPRF`: a circular 2D Gaussian PRF model
  parameterized in terms of the position, total flux, and FWHM.

- `~photutils.psf.CircularGaussianSigmaPRF`: a circular 2D Gaussian PRF
  model parameterized in terms of the position, total flux, and sigma
  (standard deviation).

- `~photutils.psf.MoffatPSF`: a 2D Moffat PSF model parameterized in
  terms of the position, total flux, :math:`\alpha`, and :math:`\beta`
  parameters.

- `~photutils.psf.AiryDiskPSF`: a 2D Airy disk PSF model parameterized
  in terms of the position, total flux, and radius of the first dark
  ring.

Note there are two types of defined models, PSF and PRF models. The PSF
models are evaluated by sampling the analytic function at the input (x,
y) coordinates. The PRF models are evaluated by integrating the analytic
function over the pixel areas.

If one needs a custom PRF model based on an analytical PSF model, an
efficient option is to first discretize the model on a grid using
:func:`~astropy.convolution.discretize_model` with the ``'oversample'``
or ``'integrate'`` ``mode``. The resulting 2D image can then be used as
the input to ``FittableImageModel`` (see :ref:`psf-image_models` below)
to create an ePSF model.

Note that the non-circular Gaussian and Moffat models above have
additional parameters beyond the standard PSF model parameters of
position and flux (``x_0``, ``y_0``, and ``flux``). By default, these
other parameters are "fixed" (i.e., not varied during the fitting
process). The user can choose to also vary these parameters by setting
the ``fixed`` attribute on the model parameter to `False`.

Photutils also provides a convenience function called
:func:`~photutils.psf.make_psf_model` that creates a PSF model from
an Astropy fittable 2D model. However, it is recommended that one use
the PSF models provided by `photutils.psf` (if possible) as they are
optimized for PSF photometry. If a custom PSF model is needed, one can
be created using the Astropy modeling framework that will provide better
performance than using :func:`~photutils.psf.make_psf_model`.

.. _psf-image_models:

Image-based PSF Models
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Image-based PSF models are typically derived from observed data or from
detailed optical modeling. The PSF model can be a single PSF model for
the entire image or a grid of PSF models at fiducial detector positions,
which are then interpolated for specific locations.

The model classes below provide the tools needed to perform PSF
photometry within Photutils using the Astropy modeling and fitting
framework. The user must provide the image-based PSF model as an input
to these classes. The input image(s) can be oversampled to increase the
accuracy of the PSF model.

- `~photutils.psf.ImagePSF`: a general class for image-based PSF models
  that allows for intensity scaling and translations.

- `~photutils.psf.GriddedPSFModel`: a PSF model that contains a grid of
  image-based ePSF models at fiducial detector positions.


.. _psf-photometry-examples:

PSF Photometry Examples
-----------------------

Let's start with a simple example using simulated stars whose PSF is
assumed to be Gaussian. We'll create a synthetic image using tools
provided by the :ref:`photutils.datasets <datasets>` module::

    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> from photutils.datasets import make_noise_image
    >>> from photutils.psf import CircularGaussianPRF, make_psf_model_image
    >>> psf_model = CircularGaussianPRF(flux=1, fwhm=2.7)
    >>> psf_shape = (9, 9)
    >>> n_sources = 10
    >>> shape = (101, 101)
    >>> data, true_params = make_psf_model_image(shape, psf_model, n_sources,
    ...                                          model_shape=psf_shape,
    ...                                          flux=(500, 700),
    ...                                          min_separation=10, seed=0)
    >>> noise = make_noise_image(data.shape, mean=0, stddev=1, seed=0)
    >>> data += noise
    >>> error = np.abs(noise)

Let's plot the image:

.. plot::

    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    from photutils.datasets import make_noise_image
    from photutils.psf import CircularGaussianPRF, make_psf_model_image

    psf_model = CircularGaussianPRF(flux=1, fwhm=2.7)
    psf_shape = (9, 9)
    n_sources = 10
    shape = (101, 101)
    data, true_params = make_psf_model_image(shape, psf_model, n_sources,
                                             model_shape=psf_shape,
                                             flux=(500, 700),
                                             min_separation=10, seed=0)
    noise = make_noise_image(data.shape, mean=0, stddev=1, seed=0)
    data += noise
    plt.imshow(data, origin='lower')
    plt.title('Simulated Data')
    plt.colorbar()


Fitting multiple stars
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Now let's use `~photutils.psf.PSFPhotometry` to perform PSF photometry
on the stars in this image. Note that the input image must be
background-subtracted prior to using the photometry classes. See
:ref:`background` for tools to subtract a global background from an
image. This step is not needed for our synthetic image because it does
not include background.

We'll use the `~photutils.detection.DAOStarFinder` class for
source detection. We'll estimate the initial fluxes of each
source using a circular aperture with a radius 4 pixels. The
central 5x5 pixel region of each star will be fit using an
`~photutils.psf.CircularGaussianPRF` PSF model. First, let's create an
instance of the `~photutils.psf.PSFPhotometry` class::

    >>> from photutils.detection import DAOStarFinder
    >>> from photutils.psf import PSFPhotometry
    >>> psf_model = CircularGaussianPRF(flux=1, fwhm=2.7)
    >>> fit_shape = (5, 5)
    >>> finder = DAOStarFinder(6.0, 2.0)
    >>> psfphot = PSFPhotometry(psf_model, fit_shape, finder=finder,
    ...                         aperture_radius=4)

To perform the PSF fitting, we then call the class instance
on the data array, and optionally an error and mask array. A
`~astropy.nddata.NDData` object holding the data, error, and mask arrays
can also be input into the ``data`` parameter. Note that all non-finite
(e.g., NaN or inf) data values are automatically masked. Here we input
the data and error arrays::

    >>> phot = psfphot(data, error=error)

A table of initial PSF model parameter values can also be input when
calling the class instance. An example of that is shown later.

Equivalently, one can input an `~astropy.nddata.NDData` object with any
uncertainty object that can be converted to standard-deviation errors:

.. doctest-skip::

    >>> from astropy.nddata import NDData, StdDevUncertainty
    >>> uncertainty = StdDevUncertainty(error)
    >>> nddata = NDData(data, uncertainty=uncertainty)
    >>> phot2 = psfphot(nddata)

The result is an astropy `~astropy.table.Table` with columns for the
source and group identification numbers, the x, y, and flux initial,
fit, and error values, local background, number of unmasked pixels
fit, the group size, quality-of-fit metrics, and flags. See the
`~photutils.psf.PSFPhotometry` documentation for descriptions of the
output columns.

The full table cannot be shown here as it has many columns, but let's
print the source ID along with the fit x, y, and flux values::

    >>> phot['x_fit'].info.format = '.4f'  # optional format
    >>> phot['y_fit'].info.format = '.4f'
    >>> phot['flux_fit'].info.format = '.4f'
    >>> print(phot[('id', 'x_fit', 'y_fit', 'flux_fit')])  # doctest: +FLOAT_CMP
     id  x_fit   y_fit  flux_fit
    --- ------- ------- --------

      6 79.8763 61.1380 648.1658

     10 71.8414 90.5842 692.3373

Let's create the residual image::

    >>> resid = psfphot.make_residual_image(data, (9, 9))

and plot it:

.. plot::

    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    import numpy as np
    from astropy.visualization import simple_norm
    from photutils.datasets import make_noise_image
    from photutils.detection import DAOStarFinder
    from photutils.psf import (CircularGaussianPRF, PSFPhotometry,
                               make_psf_model_image)

    psf_model = CircularGaussianPRF(flux=1, fwhm=2.7)
    psf_shape = (9, 9)
    n_sources = 10
    shape = (101, 101)

    data, true_params = make_psf_model_image(shape, psf_model, n_sources,
                                             model_shape=psf_shape,
                                             flux=(500, 700),
                                             min_separation=10, seed=0)
    noise = make_noise_image(data.shape, mean=0, stddev=1, seed=0)
    data += noise
    error = np.abs(noise)

    psf_model = CircularGaussianPRF(flux=1, fwhm=2.7)
    fit_shape = (5, 5)
    finder = DAOStarFinder(6.0, 2.0)
    psfphot = PSFPhotometry(psf_model, fit_shape, finder=finder,
                            aperture_radius=4)
    phot = psfphot(data, error=error)

    resid = psfphot.make_residual_image(data, (9, 9))

    fig, ax = plt.subplots(nrows=1, ncols=3, figsize=(15, 5))
    norm = simple_norm(data, 'sqrt', percent=99)
    ax[0].imshow(data, origin='lower', norm=norm)
    ax[1].imshow(data - resid, origin='lower', norm=norm)
    im = ax[2].imshow(resid, origin='lower', norm=norm)
    ax[0].set_title('Data')
    ax[1].set_title('Model')
    ax[2].set_title('Residual Image')
    plt.tight_layout()

The residual image looks like noise, indicating good fits to the
sources.

Further details about the PSF fitting can be obtained from attributes on
the `~photutils.psf.PSFPhotometry` instance. For example, the results
from the ``finder`` instance called during PSF fitting can be accessed
using the ``finder_results`` attribute (the ``finder`` returns an
astropy table)::

    >>> psfphot.finder_results['xcentroid'].info.format = '.4f'  # optional format
    >>> psfphot.finder_results['ycentroid'].info.format = '.4f'  # optional format

The ``fit_info`` attribute contains a dictionary with detailed
information returned from the ``fitter`` for each source::

    >>> psfphot.fit_info.keys()
    dict_keys(['fit_infos', 'fit_error_indices'])

The ``fit_error_indices`` key contains the indices of sources for which
the fit reported warnings or errors.

As an example, let's print the covariance matrix of the fit parameters
for the first source (note that not all astropy fitters will return a
covariance matrix):

Fitting a single source
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In some cases, one may want to fit only a single source (or few sources)
in an image. We can do that by defining a table of the sources that
we want to fit. For this example, let's fit the single star at ``(x,
y) = (63, 49)``. We first define a table with this position and then
pass that table into the ``init_params`` keyword when calling the PSF
photometry class on the data::

    >>> from astropy.table import QTable
    >>> init_params = QTable()
    >>> init_params['x'] = [63]
    >>> init_params['y'] = [49]
    >>> phot = psfphot(data, error=error, init_params=init_params)

The PSF photometry class allows for flexible input column names
using a heuristic to identify the x, y, and flux columns. See
`~photutils.psf.PSFPhotometry` for more details.

The output table contains only the fit results for the input source::

    >>> phot['x_fit'].info.format = '.4f'  # optional format
    >>> phot['y_fit'].info.format = '.4f'
    >>> phot['flux_fit'].info.format = '.4f'
    >>> print(phot[('id', 'x_fit', 'y_fit', 'flux_fit')])  # doctest: +FLOAT_CMP
     id  x_fit   y_fit  flux_fit
    --- ------- ------- --------
      1 63.2340 48.6408 563.3426

Finally, let's show the residual image. The red circular aperture shows
the location of the star that was fit and subtracted.

.. _psf-forced-photometry:

Forced Photometry (Fixed Model Parameters)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In general, the three parameters fit for each source are the x and
y positions and the flux. However, the astropy modeling and fitting
framework allows any of these parameters to be fixed during the fitting.

Let's say you want to fix the (x, y) position for each source. You can
do that by setting the ``fixed`` attribute on the model parameters::

    >>> psf_model2 = CircularGaussianPRF(flux=1, fwhm=2.7)
    >>> psf_model2.x_0.fixed = True
    >>> psf_model2.y_0.fixed = True
    >>> psf_model2.fixed
    {'flux': False, 'x_0': True, 'y_0': True, 'fwhm': True}

Now when the model is fit, the flux will be varied but, the (x, y)
position will be fixed at its initial position for every source. Let's
just fit a single source (defined in ``init_params``)::

    >>> psfphot = PSFPhotometry(psf_model2, fit_shape, finder=finder,
    ...                         aperture_radius=4)
    >>> phot = psfphot(data, error=error, init_params=init_params)

The output table shows that the (x, y) position was unchanged, with the
fit values being identical to the initial values. However, the flux was
fit::

    >>> phot['flux_init'].info.format = '.4f'  # optional format
    >>> phot['flux_fit'].info.format = '.4f'
    >>> print(phot[('id', 'x_init', 'y_init', 'flux_init', 'x_fit',
    ...             'y_fit', 'flux_fit')])  # doctest: +FLOAT_CMP
     id x_init y_init flux_init x_fit y_fit flux_fit
    --- ------ ------ --------- ----- ----- --------
      1     63     49  556.5067  63.0  49.0 500.2997


.. _psf-bounded-parameters:

Bounded Model Parameters
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The astropy modeling and fitting framework also allows for bounding the
parameter values during the fitting process. However, not all astropy
"Fitter" classes support parameter bounds. Please see `Fitting Model to
Data <https://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/modeling/fitting.html>`_ for
more details.

The model parameter bounds apply to all sources in the image,
thus this mechanism cannot be used to bound the x and y positions
of individual sources. However, the x and y positions can be
bounded for individual sources during the fitting by using the
``xy_bounds`` keyword in `~photutils.psf.PSFPhotometry` and
`~photutils.psf.IterativePSFPhotometry`. This keyword accepts a tuple of
floats representing the maximum distance in pixels that a fitted source
can be from its initial (x, y) position.

For example, you may want to constrain the flux of a source to be
between certain values or ensure that it is a non-negative value. This
can be done by setting the ``bounds`` attribute on the input PSF model
parameters. Here we constrain the flux to be greater than or equal to
0::

    >>> psf_model3 = CircularGaussianPRF(flux=1, fwhm=2.7)
    >>> psf_model3.flux.bounds = (0, None)
    >>> psf_model3.bounds
    {'flux': (0.0, None), 'x_0': (None, None), 'y_0': (None, None), 'fwhm': (None, None)}

The model parameter ``bounds`` can also be set using the ``min`` and/or
``max`` attributes. Here we set the minimum flux to be 0::

    >>> psf_model3.flux.min = 0
    >>> psf_model3.bounds
    {'flux': (0.0, None), 'x_0': (None, None), 'y_0': (None, None), 'fwhm': (None, None)}

For this example, let's constrain the flux value to be between between
400 and 600::

    >>> psf_model3 = CircularGaussianPRF(flux=1, fwhm=2.7)
    >>> psf_model3.flux.bounds = (400, 600)
    >>> psf_model3.bounds
    {'flux': (400.0, 600.0), 'x_0': (None, None), 'y_0': (None, None), 'fwhm': (None, None)}


Source Grouping
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Source grouping is an optional feature. To turn it on, create a
`~photutils.psf.SourceGrouper` instance and input it via the ``grouper``
keyword. Here we'll group stars that are within 20 pixels of each
other::

    >>> from photutils.psf import SourceGrouper
    >>> grouper = SourceGrouper(min_separation=20)
    >>> psfphot = PSFPhotometry(psf_model, fit_shape, finder=finder,
    ...                         grouper=grouper, aperture_radius=4)
    >>> phot = psfphot(data, error=error)

The ``group_id`` column shows that seven groups were identified. The
stars in each group were simultaneously fit::

    >>> print(phot[('id', 'group_id', 'group_size')])
     id group_id group_size
    --- -------- ----------
      1        1          1
      2        2          1
      3        3          1
      4        4          1
      5        5          3
      6        5          3
      7        5          3
      8        6          2
      9        6          2
     10        7          1

Care should be taken in defining the star groups. Simultaneously fitting
very large star groups is computationally expensive and error-prone.
Internally, source grouping requires the creation of a compound Astropy
model. Due to the way compound Astropy models are currently constructed,
large groups also require excessively large amounts of memory; this will
hopefully be fixed in a future Astropy version. A warning will be raised
if the number of sources in a group exceeds 25.


Local Background Subtraction
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To subtract a local background from each source, define a
`~photutils.background.LocalBackground` instance and input it via
the ``localbkg_estimator`` keyword. Here we'll use an annulus with
an inner and outer radius of 5 and 10 pixels, respectively, with the
`~photutils.background.MMMBackground` statistic (with its default sigma
clipping)::

    >>> from photutils.background import LocalBackground, MMMBackground
    >>> bkgstat = MMMBackground()
    >>> localbkg_estimator = LocalBackground(5, 10, bkgstat)
    >>> finder = DAOStarFinder(10.0, 2.0)
    >>> psfphot = PSFPhotometry(psf_model, fit_shape, finder=finder,
    ...                         grouper=grouper, aperture_radius=4,
    ...                         localbkg_estimator=localbkg_estimator)
    >>> phot = psfphot(data, error=error)

The local background values are output in the table::

    >>> phot['local_bkg'].info.format = '.4f'  # optional format
    >>> print(phot[('id', 'local_bkg')])  # doctest: +FLOAT_CMP
     id local_bkg
    --- ---------
      1   -0.0839
      2    0.1784
      3    0.2593
      4   -0.0574
      5    0.2492
      6   -0.0818
      7   -0.1130
      8   -0.2166
      9    0.0102
     10    0.3926

The local background values can also be input directly using the
``init_params`` keyword.


Iterative PSF Photometry
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Now let's use the `~photutils.psf.IterativePSFPhotometry` class to
iteratively fit the stars in the image. This class is useful for crowded
fields where faint stars are very close to bright stars. The faint stars
may not be detected until after the bright stars are subtracted.

For this simple example, let's input a table of three stars for the
first fit iteration. Subsequent iterations will use the ``finder`` to
find additional stars::

    >>> from photutils.background import LocalBackground, MMMBackground
    >>> from photutils.psf import IterativePSFPhotometry
    >>> fit_shape = (5, 5)
    >>> finder = DAOStarFinder(10.0, 2.0)
    >>> bkgstat = MMMBackground()
    >>> localbkg_estimator = LocalBackground(5, 10, bkgstat)
    >>> init_params = QTable()
    >>> init_params['x'] = [54, 29, 80]
    >>> init_params['y'] = [8, 26, 29]
    >>> psfphot2 = IterativePSFPhotometry(psf_model, fit_shape, finder=finder,
    ...                                   localbkg_estimator=localbkg_estimator,
    ...                                   aperture_radius=4)
    >>> phot = psfphot2(data, error=error, init_params=init_params)

The table output from `~photutils.psf.IterativePSFPhotometry` contains a
column called ``iter_detected`` that returns the fit iteration in which
the source was detected::

    >>> phot['x_fit'].info.format = '.4f'  # optional format
    >>> phot['y_fit'].info.format = '.4f'
    >>> phot['flux_fit'].info.format = '.4f'
    >>> print(phot[('id', 'iter_detected', 'x_fit', 'y_fit', 'flux_fit')])  # doctest: +FLOAT_CMP
     id iter_detected  x_fit   y_fit  flux_fit
    --- ------------- ------- ------- --------

      3             1 79.6273 28.7480 613.0496
      4             2 63.2340 48.6415 564.1528
      5             2 88.8856 54.1203 615.4907
      6             2 79.8765 61.1359 649.9589
      7             2 90.9631 72.0880 603.7433
      8             2  7.8203 78.5821 641.8223
      9             2  5.5350 89.8870 539.5237

Estimating the FWHM of sources
------------------------------

The `photutils.psf` package also provides a convenience function
called `~photutils.psf.fit_fwhm` to estimate the full width
at half maximum (FWHM) of one or more sources in an image.
This function fits the source(s) with a circular 2D Gaussian
PRF model (`~photutils.psf.CircularGaussianPRF`) using the
`~photutils.psf.PSFPhotometry` class. If your sources are not
circular or non-Gaussian, you can fit your sources using the
`~photutils.psf.PSFPhotometry` class using a different PSF model.

For example, let's estimate the FWHM of the sources in our example image
defined above::

   >>> from photutils.psf import fit_fwhm
   >>> finder = DAOStarFinder(6.0, 2.0)
   >>> finder_tbl = finder(data)
   >>> xypos = list(zip(finder_tbl['xcentroid'], finder_tbl['ycentroid']))
   >>> fwhm = fit_fwhm(data, xypos=xypos, error=error, fit_shape=(5, 5), fwhm=2)
   >>> fwhm  # doctest: +FLOAT_CMP
   array([2.69735154, 2.70371211, 2.68917219, 2.69310558, 2.68931721,
          2.69804194, 2.69651045, 2.70423936, 2.71458867, 2.70285813])


Convenience Gaussian Fitting Function
-------------------------------------

The `photutils.psf` package also provides a convenience function called
:func:`~photutils.psf.fit_2dgaussian` for fitting one or more sources
with a 2D Gaussian PRF model (`~photutils.psf.CircularGaussianPRF`)
using the `~photutils.psf.PSFPhotometry` class. See the function
documentation for more details and examples.
